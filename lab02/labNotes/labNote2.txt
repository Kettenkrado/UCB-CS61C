1. intro to (C)GDB: commands.
GDB with interface graphics. In course 15213's lab we're told to use gdb, but cgdb provides a more user-friendly interface.
Commands:
start: begin running and stop at line 1 in main
step(s): execute the current line (enter function)
next(n): execute the current line (not enter)
finish(fin): executes the remainder of the current function and returns to the calling function
print(p) [arg]
quit(q)
break(b) [line number or function name]
conditional break: ex. break 3 if n==4
run(r)
continue(c)
backtrace(bt) print one line per frame for frames in the stack

Should be familiar with. I did it before, now just repeat until I remember it well. In lab 2 these commands are demonstrated via the example of pwd_check, far more easier than bomblab...

2. valgrind -- segmentation fault.
Get familiar with valgrind. At least capable of reading the error message.
Exercise 6-8 are almost all on the topic of memory management.
